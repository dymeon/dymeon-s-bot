# my-discord.py-bot
My bot written with discord.py library. In that state works only on two channels. If you want it to work on your channel or on any then change line 'if(channelID==...)'on what you want. Uses prefix '$'.

Commands:

'hello' - bot will write 'Hello!'

'fish' - catch fish,'inv' - check fish that you caught(I planned to add system of levels based on fishing, but it wasn't necessary for me and my friends)

'react [channelID] [messageID] [emojiID]' - puts custom reaction under message

'emojisy' - for each custom emoji it has access to will write '[emojiName] [emojiID] [server where emoji is from]'

'version' - added to fast check discord.py version

'labyrinth' - creates 5x5 labyrinth with SanCheese(local meme emoji) in it. Sometimes they have no exit, but I tried to avoid it, so systems of labyrinths look very nice

'exit' - bot logout

'hawaii' - puts reactions 'fish-bag(with money)-goto-beach'(local meme)
